  A class is a blueprint for creating objects in object-oriented programming. It defines a set of properties and behaviors that the objects created from the class will have. A class can be thought of as a blueprint for creating instances of that class, which are commonly referred to as objects.

  Classes are used to define the structure and behavior of objects in a program. A class typically contains data members (also known as properties or fields) that represent the state of an object, and methods (also known as functions) that define the behavior of an object.

  Here is an example of a simple class in Dart:

  class Person {
  String name;
  int age;

  void printName() {
    print(name);
  }
}

  In this example, the class "Person" has two data members, name and age, which represent the name and age of a person. The class also has a method printName that prints the name of the person to the console.

  To create an object from a class, you use the new operator followed by the class name and constructor parameters (if any). For example:

  Person person = new Person();
  person.name = 'John Doe';
  person.age = 30;
  person.printName();

  In this code, a new object of type Person is created, and its name and age properties are set to 'John Doe' and 30, respectively. The printName method is then called on the object to print its name to the console
